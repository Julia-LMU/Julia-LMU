# About me
\
Hi all, I'm a PhD student in biology/botany.\
\
My doctoral research focuses on the adaptation of plants to arid desert environments. Using comparative transcriptomics, I will investigate the underlying genetic mechanisms which allow plants to survive in the extreme conditions of the desert.\
I am further interested in the systematics of liverworts, specifically of the genus _Metzgeria_.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the assembly and annotation of genomes
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Conda and GitHub (and how to do genome assemblies/annotations)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Umm... The flower of the plant _Helicodiceros muscivorus_ immitates a horse's butt to attract pollinators.

Does that count as a fun fact?
