# About me


**Julia-LMU/Julia-LMU** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the assembly and annotation of genomes
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Conda and GitHub (and how to do genome assemblies/annotations)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Umm... The flower of the plant _Helicodiceros muscivorus_ immitates a horse's butt to attract pollinators. Does that count as a fun fact?
